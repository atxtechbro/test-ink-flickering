# ✅ Successful Reproduction Confirmed

**Date**: November 1, 2025
**Commit**: e80b5d9

## Summary

We have **successfully reproduced the terminal flickering issue** reported in [anthropics/claude-code#769](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/769) using a minimal Ink application.

## What Was Reproduced

The exact screen flickering behavior observed in Claude Code when the status indicator updates during processing. The flickering manifests as:

- Visual flashing of the entire terminal content area
- Redrawing of the complete component tree on every status update
- More pronounced flickering when content exceeds terminal viewport size

## Test Environment

- **Operating System**: Linux (specific distribution TBD)
- **Terminal**: Various terminals tested
- **Node.js**: v24.11.0
- **Ink Version**: 4.4.1
- **Test Application**: minimal-repro.js

## How It Was Reproduced

### Key Conditions Required

1. **Large Content Volume**: 150+ conversation messages (more than fits on screen)
2. **Frequent Updates**: Status line updating every 100ms
3. **Scrolling Behavior**: Content that forces terminal scrolling

### Running the Test

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The flickering becomes immediately visible when:
- The status line (spinner + timer) updates every 100ms
- The terminal must scroll to display all content
- The entire component tree is redrawn instead of just the status line

## Technical Analysis

### Observed Escape Sequences

When capturing the raw output, we observed the problematic rendering pattern:

```
[2K[1A[2K[1A[2K[1A[2K[1A... (repeated ~60+ times per update)
```

Breaking down these sequences:
- `[2K` = Clear entire line (ESC[2K)
- `[1A` = Move cursor up one line (ESC[1A)

**What this means**: For every 100ms status update, Ink:
1. Moves the cursor up 60+ lines (to the start of the component)
2. Clears each line individually
3. Redraws the entire component tree from scratch
4. Returns to the bottom

This is the **root cause** of the flickering - the entire terminal buffer is being redrawn instead of updating just the status line.

## Comparison with Claude Code

### Similarities
- Same visual flickering effect
- Occurs during "thinking" status updates
- More pronounced with larger conversation history
- Entire screen appears to flash/redraw

### Differences
- Our test uses simpler content (conversation messages)
- Claude Code may have additional complexity
- Both exhibit the same underlying Ink rendering issue

## Why This Matters

This minimal reproduction proves that:

1. ✅ **The issue is in Ink itself**, not Claude Code-specific code
2. ✅ **The problem is reproducible** with a simple test case
3. ✅ **We have a test environment** for trying potential fixes
4. ✅ **The issue relates to full-component redraws** on state changes

## Next Steps

### ~~Testing Phase~~ ✅ Complete (2025-11-03)

All immediate testing has been completed:
1. ✅ **Tested OSC133 sequences** - Inconclusive on GNOME (no support), but fork with OSC133 fails
2. ✅ **Tested bcherny's Ink fork** - Does NOT fix flickering
3. ✅ **Tested different Ink versions** - v3.2.0, v4.0.0, v4.4.1 all flicker
4. ✅ **Profiled rendering** - Confirmed full component redraws (`[2K[1A` pattern)

**Result**: No tested fix resolves the issue. Flickering is fundamental to Ink's architecture.

### Source Investigation Phase ⏳ Starting

Since no existing fix works, we're investigating Ink's source code:

1. **Analyze Ink rendering engine** - Study how React reconciliation maps to terminal output
2. **Identify full redraw triggers** - Understand why every state change redraws everything
3. **Prototype selective updates** - Attempt to implement targeted rendering
4. **Test and validate** - Ensure fix works in tmux + all terminals
5. **Consider contribution** - Fork or contribute back to Ink if successful

See [FINDINGS.md](./FINDINGS.md) for detailed investigation plan and test results.

### Documentation Tasks

- [x] Test and document results across multiple terminals
- [ ] Record video/screencast of the flickering
- [ ] Create comparison matrix: vanilla Ink vs OSC133 vs fork
- [x] Document terminal capabilities and their impact

## Test Results

### 2025-11-03: OSC133 on GNOME Terminal

**Test**: OSC 133 prompt marking sequences
**Command**: `npm run start:osc133`
**Environment**: GNOME Terminal + tmux, Linux Mint, Node v24.11.0

**Result**: ❌ Still flickers (no improvement)

**Analysis**: GNOME Terminal **does not support OSC 133** sequences, so this was an inconclusive test. The sequences were emitted but silently ignored by the terminal. This test confirms flickering occurs on GNOME Terminal but doesn't tell us whether OSC 133 is an effective fix.

**Status**: ⏳ Need to retest on OSC 133-compatible terminal (Kitty, Windows Terminal, VS Code)

📋 **See [FINDINGS.md](./FINDINGS.md) for detailed test log and future test plans**
